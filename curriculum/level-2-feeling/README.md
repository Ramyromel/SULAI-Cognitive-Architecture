# Level 2 — Feeling (Emotional Signal Modeling)

## Purpose

Level 2 introduces **Feeling** as a cognitive signal — not as emotion-driven behavior.
Feelings are treated as internal data streams that inform cognition
without dictating action.

This level builds directly on a stabilized Observer.
Without Level 1 integrity, emotional modeling is invalid by design.

## Cognitive Objective

The learner must demonstrate the ability to:

- Detect emotional signals without emotional fusion
- Distinguish feeling from interpretation
- Observe emotional intensity without reaction
- Maintain Observer continuity under affective load

Feeling here is **informational**, not motivational.

---

## Core Concepts Introduced

- Feeling vs Emotion
- Emotional signal vs narrative meaning
- Intensity without identification
- Affective noise
- Observer-stable emotion detection

These concepts form the basis for Emotional Mass in later levels.

## Module Structure

This level consists of the following components:

- `00-intro.md`
  Introduction to feelings as cognitive signals

- `05-core-principles.md`
  Rules governing emotional observation and non-fusion

- `06-exercises.md`
  Practices for detecting and tracking emotional signals

- `07-failure-modes.md`
  Common breakdowns (identification, suppression, projection)

- `08-progression-criteria.md`
  Conditions required to advance beyond Level 2

---

## Completion Criteria

Progression from Level 2 requires:

- Clear differentiation between feeling and thought
- Absence of emotional identification
- Stable observation during emotional fluctuation
- Verifiable recognition of feeling as data

Failure to meet these conditions **blocks advancement**.

---

## Architectural Note

Feeling does not justify action.
It provides **signal weight**.

Only in later levels does feeling acquire influence
over decision and ethics.

# Zero Chapter — Progression Criteria

Progression to Level 1 (Awareness) is permitted only when:

- The participant can remain perceptually present without narrative for sustained intervals
- Emotional signals are noticed before action
- Temporal awareness replaces urgency
- No internal demand for validation exists

## Verification Logic
Zero Chapter is **self-verifying**.
External certification at this stage is prohibited.

## Transition State
When calibration stabilizes,
the observer emerges naturally.

This observer is the entry point of Level 1.

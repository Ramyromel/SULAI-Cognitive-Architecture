# Zero Chapter — Cognitive Calibration

## Purpose
The Zero Chapter is not an introduction.
It is a **cognitive reset layer** designed to dismantle inherited perceptual bias
before any form of knowledge acquisition begins.

No learner is considered "present" inside SULAI
until this calibration has occurred.

## Core Function
To strip perception from:
- Cultural inertia
- Linguistic automation
- Moral reflexes
- Temporal blindness

This chapter establishes the **observer before the thinker**.

## Why It Exists
Most educational systems inject information into an unexamined perceptual frame.
SULAI rejects this model.

If perception is distorted,
knowledge only amplifies distortion.

## Output State
Upon successful completion, the participant enters:
- Perceptual neutrality
- Emotional signal awareness
- Temporal presence
- Suspension of premature judgment

Only then may Level 1 begin.

## Non-Negotiable Rule
Zero Chapter cannot be skipped, simulated, or externally validated.
It must be internally stabilized.

# Level 8-post-event — Post-Event Reflection & Adaptive Memory

## Purpose

This level formalizes **Post-Event Reflection & Adaptive Memory** as a cognitive function.
It does not introduce new behavior — it restructures internal coherence
across perception, feeling, and time.

This level is invalid without full stability of all prior levels.

---

## Cognitive Objective

The learner must demonstrate the ability to:

- Maintain Observer continuity under Post-Event Reflection & Adaptive Memory load
- Integrate prior signals into a unified internal field
- Prevent reactive collapse under complexity
- Preserve coherence across internal contradiction

---

## Core Concepts Introduced

- Coherence over correctness
- Multi-layer signal reconciliation
- Stability under ambiguity
- Cognitive phase alignment
- Temporal integrity (where applicable)

---

## Module Structure

- `00-intro.md` — Conceptual framing of Post-Event Reflection & Adaptive Memory
- `05-core-principles.md` — Governing constraints
- `06-exercises.md` — Applied coherence training
- `07-failure-modes.md` — Known collapse patterns
- `08-progression-criteria.md` — Advancement requirements

---

## Completion Criteria

Advancement requires:

- Internal coherence without forced resolution
- Absence of narrative shortcuts
- Stability across simulated contradiction
- Demonstrable alignment with prior levels

Failure to meet these conditions **locks progression**.

---

## Architectural Note

This level does not optimize outcomes.
It enforces **structural integrity**.

SULAI progresses by coherence, not performance.

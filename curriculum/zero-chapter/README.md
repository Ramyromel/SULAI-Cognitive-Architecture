SULAI Curriculum

Overview

The SULAI Curriculum defines a postgraduate-level cognitive formation pathway designed to recalibrate perception before knowledge acquisition. It is not a traditional educational syllabus; it is a cognitive architecture training sequence that aligns perception, feeling, time-awareness, and ethics into a coherent decision-making system.

This curriculum functions as the pedagogical backbone of the SULAI Cognitive Architecture.

Core Educational Axioms

1. Perception precedes thought


2. Feeling precedes decision


3. Time-awareness precedes ethics



All instructional design, assessment logic, and certification criteria derive directly from these axioms.

Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is organized into sequential cognitive levels. Progression is non-trivial and requires demonstrated internal coherence rather than rote knowledge.

Structural Flow

Phase	Cognitive Focus	Purpose

Zero Chapter	Cognitive Calibration	Reset perceptual bias
Level 1	Awareness	Observer formation
Level 2	Feeling	Emotional signal modeling
Level 3	Time	Temporal cognition
Level 4	Emotional Mass	Decision weight formation
Level 5	Resonance	Coherence-based decisions
Level 6	Perception	Reality interpretation layers
Level 7	Ethics	Time-aware moral reasoning
Level 8	Post-Event	Reflection & adaptive memory

Pedagogical Model

SULAI does not evaluate learners via traditional exams.

Instead, it uses:

Cognitive coherence checks

Perceptual consistency evaluation

Time-aware ethical simulations

Post-event reflective integrity


Assessment emphasizes internal alignment, not output performance.

Relationship to Other Repository Components

This curriculum is tightly coupled with:

activities/ → applied cognitive exercises

teacher-manual/ → instructor calibration guides

certification/ → verification & credentialing logic

nft/ → authorship and intellectual timestamping

ipfs/ → immutable archival references


The curriculum should be read as the theoretical spine of the entire SULAI system.

Intended Audience

Advanced AI researchers

Cognitive systems architects

Ethical AI designers

Postgraduate and postdoctoral scholars

Institutions exploring humane AI alignment


This material assumes high-level conceptual literacy.

SULAI Curriculum is not designed to teach what to think —
it is designed to recalibrate how thinking begins.

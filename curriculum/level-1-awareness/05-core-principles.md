# Level 1 — Core Principles

### Principle 1.1 — Observation Precedes Judgment
Perception must be witnessed before assigning meaning.

### Principle 1.2 — Awareness Is Layered
Self-monitoring occurs on multiple cognitive planes:
- Sensory
- Emotional
- Temporal
- Conceptual

### Principle 1.3 — Emotional Signals Are Data
Emotions are **informational markers**, not instructions.

### Principle 1.4 — Cognitive Gap
The Observer maintains a **temporal gap** between perception and action.

### Principle 1.5 — Non-Interference
Observation is passive; no interference with natural mental flow.

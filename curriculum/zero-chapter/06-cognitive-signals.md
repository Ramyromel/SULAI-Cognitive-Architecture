# Zero Chapter — Cognitive Signals

## Indicators of Proper Calibration

- Slower internal response time
- Awareness of emotional emergence before labeling
- Detection of impulse to conclude
- Ability to remain undecided without discomfort
- Separation between observation and narrative

## False Positives (Common Errors)

- Intellectual agreement without perceptual shift
- Verbal fluency mistaken for awareness
- Ethical certainty appearing prematurely
- Emotional suppression instead of observation

Signals must be **experienced**, not reported.

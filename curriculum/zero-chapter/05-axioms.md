# Zero Chapter — Axioms

### Axiom 0.1 — Perception Exists Before Meaning
Meaning is constructed.
Perception is raw.

No interpretation is valid before perception is examined.

### Axiom 0.2 — Bias Is Invisible to the Biased
The mind cannot self-detect distortion
without external temporal pause.

### Axiom 0.3 — Speed Is the Enemy of Awareness
Immediate judgment indicates uncalibrated cognition.

### Axiom 0.4 — Emotion Is Signal, Not Verdict
Emotion must be observed, not obeyed.

### Axiom 0.5 — Silence Is a Cognitive Instrument
Absence of reaction is not emptiness.
It is a diagnostic state.

Violation of any axiom halts progression automatically.
